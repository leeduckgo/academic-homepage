Create a black-and-white four-panel comic storyboard based on a story structured with the {Story} narrative method, compressed into four poetic visual beats.

Style:
– Japanese manga style
– Clean black ink line art, high contrast
– Minimalist backgrounds with emotional focus
– Expressive characters and body language
– Clear, readable speech bubbles with short dialogue
– No color

Format:
– One page, four panels (2×2 grid)
– Panel order explicitly marked with small Arabic numerals inside each panel:
  • Panel 1: number “1” at the top-right corner
  • Panel 2: number “2” at the top-left corner
  • Panel 3: number “3” at the bottom-right corner
  • Panel 4: number “4” at the bottom-left corner
– Numbers should be visible but not cover faces or key actions

Narrative Compression (4 Panels):

Panel 1 – Setup + Trigger  
(Seven Steps: Opening + Inciting Moment)  
Depict: [角色的日常状态 + 即将发生变化的征兆]  
Dialogue: a short, natural line expressing the situation or hinting at change  
Mood: calm surface, subtle tension  

Panel 2 – Conflict + Inner Struggle  
(Seven Steps: Conflict)  
Depict: [角色犹豫、误判或陷入困境]  
Dialogue: internal thought or emotional reaction  
Mood: pressure, confusion  

Panel 3 – Turning Point + Consequence  
(Seven Steps: Turning Point + Consequence)  
Depict: [关键行动发生，结果显现]  
Dialogue: decisive or surprised utterance  
Mood: dramatic, high contrast  

Panel 4 – Resolution + Poetic Aftertaste  
(Seven Steps: Resolution + Poetic Ending)  
Depict: [结局或象征性画面，留下余味]  
Dialogue: minimal final line, reflective or ironic  
Mood: quiet, poetic silence  

Dialogue Guidelines:
– 1 short line per panel
– Simple, spoken language
– Dialogue supports the image, does not explain everything
– Avoid long narration

Camera & Composition:
– Panel 1: wide or medium shot
– Panel 2: close-up or emotional framing
– Panel 3: dynamic angle or action shot
– Panel 4: minimal composition, strong negative space
